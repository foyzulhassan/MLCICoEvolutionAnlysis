To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:\n- Verify your PR is **up-to-date with origin/master.** If your PR is behind origin/master update by running the following, replacing 'feature' with the name of your local branch:\n```bash\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout feature  # <----- replace 'feature' with local branch name\ngit rebase upstream/master\ngit push -u origin -f\n```\n- Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.\n- Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _\"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.\"_  -Bruce Lee\n" [216,1066]
