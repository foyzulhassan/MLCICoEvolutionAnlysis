To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:\n\n- ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `ultralytics/yolov3` `master` branch. If your PR is behind you can update your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.\n- ✅ Verify all YOLOv3 Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.\n- ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _\"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.\"_  — Bruce Lee\n" [258,953]
