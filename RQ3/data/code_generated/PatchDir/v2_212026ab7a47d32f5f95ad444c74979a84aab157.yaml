      # This is quite possibly an excessively long list of build/test steps,
      # since I don't know the exact process that really needs to be used to
      # test everything.  Note also that this calls `nyc ...` directly rather
      # than using the "coverage" script, as that script always pushes coverage
      # info to codecov, and we don't need *every* build's info pushed.
